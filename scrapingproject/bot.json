During his life, Salzburg was not part of the Archduchy of Austria, but an essentially sovereign state called the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg within the Bavarian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire. It was only in 1805, 14 years after his death, that Salzburg was annexed to the Austrian Empire.[38]\nMozart did not die from poisoning, and was not poisoned by his colleague Antonio Salieri or anyone else.[39] The false rumor originated soon after his death, and was dramatized in the well-known 1984 film Amadeus.[40]\nThe minuet in G major by Christian Petzold is commonly attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach, although the piece was identified in the 1970s as a movement from a harpsichord suite by Petzold. The misconception stems from Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, a book of sheet music by various composers (mostly Bach) in which the minuet is found.[41] Compositions that are doubtful as works of Bach are catalogued as \"BWV Anh.\", short for \"Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis Anhang; Bach works catalogue annex\", the minuet being assigned to BWV Anh. 114.\nThe \"Minute Waltz\" takes, on average, two minutes to play as originally written.[42] Its name comes from the adjective minute, as in small, and not the noun; it is thus a case of heteronym confusion.[43]\n\"Don't Worry, Be Happy\", written and sung by Bobby McFerrin, is commonly believed to be sung by Bob Marley instead.[44] Indeed, a YouTube video entitled \"Bob Marley - Don't worry be Happy\" has over 146 million views.[45] However, the famous reggae musician Marley never recorded a version of \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\", as he died seven years before the song was written.[44] \"Three Little Birds,\" which Marley did write, includes a similar line: \"don't worry about a thing, every little thing's gonna be all right.\"[46]\nParody singer \"Weird Al\" Yankovic did not write or perform most of the songs and comedy sketches attributed to him or \"Weird Al Yankovich\" on the Internet.[47]"},

{"datas": "The forbidden fruit mentioned in the Book of Genesis is never identified as an apple,[50] a misconception widely depicted in Western art. The original Hebrew texts mention only tree and fruit. Early Latin translations use the word mali, which can mean either \"evil\" or \"apple\" depending on if the A is short or long respectively, although the difference in vowel length had already vanished from speech in Latin at the time. In early Germanic languages the word \"apple\" and its cognates usually simply meant \"fruit\". German and French artists commonly depict the fruit as an apple from the 12th century onwards, and John Milton's Areopagitica from 1644 explicitly mentions the fruit as an apple.[51] Jewish scholars have suggested that the fruit could have been a grape, a fig, an apricot, or an etrog.[52]\nWhile they are forbidden by the Book of Leviticus, having tattoos does not mean someone cannot be buried in a Jewish cemetery as is commonly believed, just as violating any other prohibition does not prevent a Jewish person from ultimately being buried in a Jewish cemetery.[53]"},
{"datas": "Jesus was most likely not born on any date corresponding to December 25, the date on  which his birth is traditionally celebrated as Christmas. It is more likely that his birth was in either the season of spring or perhaps summer, while December 25 in the Northern Hemisphere is at the beginning of winter. Also, although the Common Era ostensibly counts the years since his birth,[54] it is unlikely that he was born in either AD 1 or 1 BC, as such a numbering system would imply. Modern historians estimate a date closer to between 6 BC and 4 BC.[55]\nThe Bible does not say that exactly three magi came to visit the baby Jesus, nor that they were kings, or rode on camels, or that their names were Casper, Melchior, and Balthazar, nor what color their skin was. Three magi are inferred because three gifts are described, but we only know that they were plural (at least 2); there could have been many more and probably an entourage accompanied them on their journey. The artistic depictions of the nativity have almost always depicted three magi since the 3rd century.[56] The Bible only specifies an upper limit of 2 years for the interval between the birth and the visit (Matthew 2:16), and artistic depictions and the closeness of the traditional dates of December 25 and January 6 encourage the popular assumption that the visit took place in the same season as the birth, but later traditions varied, with the visit taken as occurring up to two years later. The association of magi with kings comes from efforts to tie the visit to prophecies in the Book of Isaiah.[57]"},
{"datas": "The idea that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute before she met Jesus is not found in the Bible or in any of the other earliest Christian writings. The misconception likely arose due to a conflation between Mary Magdalene, Mary of Bethany (who anoints Jesus's feet in John 11:1\u201312), and the unnamed \"sinful woman\" who anoints Jesus's feet in Luke 7:36\u201350.[58]\nPaul the Apostle did not change his name from Saul. He was born Jewish, with Roman citizenship inherited from his father, and thus carried both a Hebrew and a Greco-Roman name from birth. Luke indicates the coexistence of the names in Acts 13:9: \"...Saul, who also is called Paul...\".[59]\nThe Roman Catholic dogma of the Immaculate Conception does not state that Jesus or his mother Mary was born to a virgin. Rather, it states that Mary was not in a state of original sin from the moment of her own conception.[60]\nRoman Catholic dogma does not say that the pope is either sinless or always infallible.[61] Catholic dogma since 1870 does state that a dogmatic teaching contained in divine revelation that is promulgated by the pope (deliberately, and under certain very specific circumstances; generally called ex cathedra) is free from error, although official invocation of papal infallibility is rare. While most theologians state that canonizations meet the requisites,[62] aside from that, most recent popes have finished their reign without a single invocation of infallibility. Otherwise, even when speaking in his official capacity, dogma does not hold that he is free from error.\nSt. Peter's Basilica is not the mother church of Roman Catholicism, nor is it the official seat of the Pope.[63] These equivalent distinctions belong to the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, which is located in Rome outside of Vatican City but over which the Vatican has extraterritorial jurisdiction.[63] This also means that St. Peter's is not a cathedral in the literal sense of that word.[63] St. Peter's is, however, used as the principal church for many papal functions.[63]\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) no longer practice polygamy.[64] Currently, the LDS Church excommunicates any members who practice polygamy within the organization.[65] However, some Mormon fundamentalist sects still practice polygamy within their groups.[66] For more details on this subject, see Mormonism and polygamy."},

It covers the entire body, head and face, including her eyes, with a mesh window or grille for the woman to see. The term is often incorrectly used to refer to other garments worn by Muslim women, such as the niqab (which shows the eyes) and the hijab (which shows the entire face but conceals the rest of the body, including the hair).[67] While the burqa is often light blue or white, the niqab is generally black and the hijab is a veil that can be of any color.\nA fatw\u0101 is a non-binding legal opinion issued by an Islamic scholar under Islamic law; it is therefore commonplace for fat\u0101w\u0101 from different authors to disagree. The popular misconception[68] that the word means a death sentence probably stems from the fatw\u0101 issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran in 1989 regarding the author Salman Rushdie, who he stated had earned a death sentence for blasphemy. This event led to fat\u0101w\u0101 gaining widespread media attention in the West.[69]\nThe word \"jihad\" does not always mean \"holy war\"; literally, the word in Arabic means \"struggle\". While there is such a thing as \"jihad bil saif\", or jihad \"by the sword\",[70] many modern Islamic scholars usually say that it implies an effort or struggle of a spiritual kind.[71] Scholar Louay Safi asserts that \"misconceptions and misunderstandings regarding the nature of war and peace in Islam are widespread in both the Muslim societies and the West\", as much following 9/11 as before.[72]\nThe Quran does not promise martyrs 72 virgins in heaven. It does mention companions, houri, to all people\u2014martyr or not\u2014in heaven, but no number is specified. The source for the 72 virgins is a hadith in Sunan al-Tirmidhi by Imam Tirmidhi.[73][74] Hadiths are sayings and acts of the prophet Muhammad as reported by others, and as such they are not part of the Quran itself. Muslims are not meant to necessarily believe all hadiths, and that applies particularly to those hadiths that are weakly sourced, such as this one.[75] Furthermore, the correct translation of this particular hadith is a matter of debate.[73] In the same collection of Sunni hadiths, however, the following is judged strong (hasan sahih): \"There are six things with Allah for the martyr. He is forgiven with the first flow of blood (he suffers), he is shown his place in Paradise, he is protected from punishment in the grave, secured from the greatest terror, the crown of dignity is placed upon his head\u2014and its gems are better than the world and what is in it\u2014he is married to seventy two wives among wide-eyed houris (Al-Huril-'Ayn) of Paradise, and he may intercede for seventy of his close relatives.\"[76]"},

It was introduced for judo in the 1880s to indicate competency at all of the basic techniques of the sport. Promotion beyond 1st dan (the first black belt rank) varies among different martial arts. In judo and derived martial arts such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, holders of higher master ranks are awarded alternating red and white panels, and the highest grandmasters wear solid red belts.[80] Other arts such as taekwondo  use black belts with a number of gold bars to indicate the holder's dan rank.\nThe use of triangular corner flags in English football is not a privilege reserved for those teams that have won an FA Cup in the past, despite a wide belief to the contrary[81] that inspired a scene in the film Twin Town. The Football Association's rules are silent on the subject, and often the decision over what shape flag to use has been up to the individual club's groundskeepers.[82]\nIndia did not withdraw from the 1950 FIFA World Cup because their squad played barefoot, which was against FIFA regulations.[83] In reality, India withdrew because the country's managing body, the All India Football Federation (AIFF), was insufficiently prepared for the team's participation and gave various reasons for withdrawing, including a lack of funding and prioritizing the Olympics.[84] However, the myth frequently resurfaces in both India and abroad as fact (especially come World Cup time).[85] The AIFF itself may have been the source of this myth.[86]"},
{"datas": "Nonstandard, slang, or colloquial terms used by English speakers are sometimes alleged not to be real words, despite appearing in numerous dictionaries. All words in English became accepted by being commonly used for a certain period of time; thus, there are many vernacular words currently not accepted as part of the standard language, or regarded as inappropriate in formal speech or writing, but the idea that they are somehow not words is a misconception.[87] Examples of words that are sometimes alleged not to be words include \"irregardless\",[88] \"conversate\", \"funnest\",[89] \"mentee\", \"impactful\", and \"thusly\",[90] all of which appear in numerous dictionaries as English words.[91]\nThe pronunciation of coronal fricatives in Spanish did not come around as imitation of a lisping king. Only one Spanish king, Peter of Castile, is documented as having a lisp, and the current pronunciation originated two centuries after his death.[92]\nThe Chevrolet Nova sold very well in Latin American markets; General Motors did not need to rename the car. While \"no va\" does mean \"doesn't go\" in Spanish, \"nova\" was easily understood to mean \"new\" due to its similarity to the Spanish word \"nueva,\" with which it shares a common origin. Drivers in Mexico and Venezuela, where it was first sold, bought it eagerly. There was no need to change the model name,[93] despite claims to the contrary.[94]\nSign languages are not the same worldwide. Aside from the pidgin International Sign, each country generally has its own native sign language, and some have more than one (although there are also substantial similarities among all sign languages).[95]\nEskimo tribes, such as the Inuit and Aleut, do not have a disproportionate number of words representing snow in their languages. The myth comes from a misconstruction of Franz Boas's original statement noting that Eskimos had a variety of words for various snow-related concepts; Boas noted that the same was true of English.[96]\nThe word \"the\" was never pronounced or spelled \"ye\" in Old or Middle English.[97] The confusion, seen in the common stock phrase \"ye olde,\" derives from the use of the character thorn (\u00fe), which in Middle English represented the sound now represented in Modern English by \"th.\" In blackletter, \u00fe and y were difficult to distinguish, meaning that \"\u00fee\" () very closely resembled \"ye.\"[98]\nThe Hopi people do in fact have a concept of time, and the Hopi language does have ways of expressing temporal concepts, though they are organized differently from those in Western languages.[99]\nThe Chinese word for \"crisis\" (\u5371\u673a) is not composed of the symbols for \"danger\" and \"opportunity;\" the first does represent danger, but the second instead means \"inflection point\" (the original meaning of the word \"crisis\").[100] The myth was perpetuated mainly by a campaign speech from John F.

The earliest certain recorded use of \"fuck\" in English comes from c. 1475, in the poem \"Flen flyys\", where it is spelled fuccant (conjugated as if a Latin verb meaning \"they fuck\").

An \u1f30\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 was simply a private citizen as opposed to a government official. Later, the word came to mean any sort of non-expert or layman, then someone uneducated or ignorant, and much later to mean stupid or mentally deficient.[128]\nThere is no evidence that the Roman salute, in which the arm is fully extended forwards or diagonally with fingers touching, was actually used in ancient Rome for greeting or any other purpose.[129] The idea that the salute was popular in ancient times originated in the 1784 painting Oath of the Horatii by French artist Jacques-Louis David, which inspired later salutes, most notably the Nazi salute.\nVomiting was not a regular part of Roman dining customs.[130] In ancient Rome, the architectural feature called a vomitorium was the entranceway through which crowds entered and exited a stadium, not a special room used for purging food during meals.[131]\nThe death of Greek philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria at the hands of a mob of Christian monks in 415 was mainly a result of her involvement in a bitter political feud between her close friend and student Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, and the bishop Cyril, not her religious views.[132] Her death also had nothing to do with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria,[133] which had likely already ceased to exist centuries before Hypatia was born.[133]\nScipio Aemilianus did not plow over the city of Carthage and sow it with salt after defeating it in the Third Punic War.[134]\nContrary to popular belief, Roman dictator Julius Caesar was not born via caesarean section.[135] Such a procedure would have been fatal to the mother at the time,[136] and historical evidence indicates Caesar's mother being alive during his own lifetime. Although the names are similar, the caesarean section was not named after Caesar, as is commonly believed; more likely is that it is derived from the Roman verb caedere, meaning \"to cut.\""},
{"datas": "The Middle Ages were not \"a time of ignorance, barbarism and superstition\", and the Church did not place religious authority over personal experience and rational activity.[137] Historian of science Edward Grant writes that \"If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed in the Age of Reason, they were made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities\".[138] Furthermore, historian of science David C. Lindberg says that, contrary to common belief, \"the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led\".[139] Describing the period as the \"Dark Ages\" in that matter is a common misconception that persists to this day among the lay public.\nWhile it is true that modern life expectancies are much higher, by any measure, than they were in the Middle Ages and earlier,[140] there is no evidence that adults in the Middle Ages were expected to live to an average of 30 or 40 years old. According to statistics this was the average at birth, as earlier low life expectancies were very strongly influenced by high infant and adolescent mortality. On the other hand, the average life expectancy among people who lived to adulthood was much higher.[141] A 21-year-old man in medieval England, for example, could by one estimate expect to live to the age of 64.[142] Age specific forecasts, particularly life expectancy after childhood, can be dramatically different from life expectancy at birth, especially in preindustrial times.[141]\nThere is no evidence that Vikings wore horns on their helmets; this would have been highly impractical in battle.[143] In fact, the image of Vikings wearing horned helmets stems from the scenography of an 1876 production of the Der Ring des Nibelungen opera cycle by Richard Wagner.[144]\nVikings did not drink out of the skulls of vanquished enemies. This was based on a mistranslation of the skaldic poetic use of \u00f3r bj\u00fagvi\u00f0um hausa (branches of skulls) to refer to drinking horns.[145]\nVikings did not name Iceland \"Iceland\" as a ploy to discourage others from settling it. Naddodd and Hrafna-Fl\u00f3ki Vilger\u00f0arson both saw snow and ice on the island when they traveled there, giving the island its name.[146] Greenland, on the other hand, was named in the hope that it would help attract settlers.[147]\nKing Canute did not command the tide to reverse in a fit of delusional arrogance.[148] His intent that day, if indeed the incident did occur, was most likely to prove a point to members of his privy council that no man is all-powerful, and we all must bend to forces beyond our control, such as the tides.\nThere is no evidence that iron maidens were used for torture, or even yet invented, in the Middle Ages. Instead they were pieced together in the 18th century from several artifacts found in museums in order to create spectacular objects intended for (commercial) exhibition.[149]"},
{"datas": "Spiral staircases in castles were not designed in a clockwise direction to hinder right-handed attackers.[150][151] While clockwise spiral staircases are more common in castles than anti-clockwise, they were even more common in medieval structures without a military role such as religious buildings.[152] Studies of spiral stairs in castle have concluded that \"the role and position of spirals in castles\u00a0... had a much stronger domestic and status role than a military function\"[152] and that \"there are sufficient examples of anticlockwise stairs in Britain and France in [the 11th and 12th centuries] to indicate that the choice must have depended both on physical convenience and architectural practicalities and there was no military ideology that demanded clockwise staircases in the cause of fighting efficiency or advantage\".[150]\nThe plate armor of European soldiers did not stop soldiers from moving around or necessitate a crane to get them into a saddle. They would as a matter of course fight on foot and could mount and dismount without help. In fact, soldiers equipped with plate armor were more mobile than those with mail armor (chain armor), as mail was heavier and required stiff padding beneath due to its pliable nature.[153] It is true that armor used in tournaments in the late Middle Ages was significantly heavier than that used in warfare,[154] which may have contributed to this misconception.\nWhether chastity belts, devices designed to prevent women from having sexual intercourse, were invented in medieval times is disputed by modern historians. Most existing chastity belts are now thought to be deliberate fakes or anti-masturbatory devices from the 19th and early 20th centuries. The latter were made due to the widespread belief that masturbation could lead to insanity, and were mostly bought by parents for their teenage children.[155]"},

{"datas": "Christopher Columbus was not the first European to visit the Americas:[162] Leif Erikson, and possibly other Vikings before him, explored Vinland, which was either the island of Newfoundland, part of modern Canada, or a term for Newfoundland and parts of the North American mainland. Ruins at L'Anse aux Meadows prove that at least one Norse settlement was built in Newfoundland, confirming a narrative in the Saga of Erik the Red. Columbus also never reached any land that now forms part of the mainland United States of America; most of the landings Columbus made on his four voyages, including the initial October 12, 1492 landing (the anniversary of which forms the basis of Columbus Day), were on Caribbean islands that are now independent countries. However, Columbus did land on the mainland of South America during his third voyage to the Americas (1498\u20131500).\nThe Mexica people of the Aztec Empire did not mistake Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and his landing party for gods during Cort\u00e9s's conquest of the empire. This myth came from Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, who never went to Mexico and conjured the myth while working for the retired Cort\u00e9s in Spain years after the conquest.[163]\nMarco Polo did not import pasta from China,[164] a misconception that originated with the Macaroni Journal, published by an association of food industries with the goal of promoting the use of pasta in the United States.[165] Marco Polo describes a food similar to \"lasagna\" in his Travels, but he uses a term with which he was already familiar. Durum wheat, and thus pasta as it is known today, was introduced by Arabs from Libya, during their conquest of Sicily in the late 9th century, according to the newsletter of the National Macaroni Manufacturers Association,[166] thus predating Marco Polo's travels to China by about four centuries.\nThe Inquisition did not demand belief in geocentrism instead of heliocentrism because of the Bible. Already, the Tychonic system was the primary model at the time, supported by such evidence as stellar parallax remaining unobserved until the 1800s. Instead, a major contributing factor to delaying support in the Copernican model was the fact that so much of the evidence for heliocentrism was already adequately explained by the Tychonic system.[167]"},
{"datas": "Contrary to the popular image of the Pilgrim Fathers, the early settlers of the Plymouth Colony in North America usually did not wear all black, and their capotains (hats) were shorter and rounder than the widely depicted tall hat with a buckle on it. Instead, their fashion was based on that of the late Elizabethan era: doublets, jerkins and ruffs. Both men and women wore the same style of shoes, stockings, capes, coats and hats in a range of colors including reds, yellows, purples, and greens.[168] According to Plimoth Plantation historian James W. Baker, the traditional image was formed in the 19th century when buckles were a kind of emblem of quaintness.[169] (The Puritans, who also settled in Massachusetts near the same time, did frequently wear all black.)[170]\nThe familiar story that Isaac Newton was inspired to research the nature of gravity by an apple hitting his head is almost certainly apocryphal. All Newton himself ever said was that the idea came to him as he sat \"in a contemplative mood\" and \"was occasioned by the fall of an apple.\"\nThe accused at the Salem witch trials in North America were not burned at the stake; about 15 died in prison, 19 were hanged and one was pressed to death.[171]\nMarie Antoinette did not say \"let them eat cake\" when she heard that the French peasantry were starving due to a shortage of bread. The phrase was first published in Rousseau's Confessions when Marie was only nine years old and most scholars believe that Rousseau coined it himself, or that it was said by Maria Theresa, the wife of Louis XIV. Even Rousseau (or Maria Theresa) did not use the exact words but actually Qu'ils mangent de la brioche, meaning \"Let them eat brioche\" (a rich type of bread). Marie Antoinette was a target of attacks from radical jacobins; therefore, political activists attributed the phrase \"let them eat cake\" to her, to promulgate an image of her as disconnected from her subjects.[172]\nGeorge Washington did not have wooden teeth. His dentures were made of gold, hippopotamus ivory, lead, animal teeth (including horse and donkey teeth),[173] and probably human teeth purchased from slaves.[174]\nThe signing of the United States Declaration of Independence did not occur on July 4, 1776. After the Second Continental Congress voted to declare independence on July 2, the final language of the document was approved on July 4, and it was printed and distributed on July 4\u20135.[175] However, the actual signing occurred on August 2, 1776.[176]\nBenjamin Franklin did not propose that the wild turkey be used as the symbol for the United States instead of the bald eagle. While he did serve on a commission that tried to design a seal after the Declaration of Independence, his proposal was an image of Moses. His objections to the eagle as a national symbol and preference for the turkey were stated in a 1784 letter to his daughter in response to the Society of the Cincinnati's use of the former; he never expressed that sentiment publicly.[177]\nBenjamin Banneker did not recall from memory or reproduce Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's plan for the city of Washington, D.C., did not assist in the planning or surveying of that city, did not write one of the first almanacs in the United States, did not invent a clock and was not one of the first people to record observations of the periodical cicada (see Mythology of Benjamin Banneker for further information and references).\nThere was never a bill to make German the official language of the United States that was defeated by one vote in the House of Representatives, nor has one been proposed at the state level. In 1794, a petition from a group of German immigrants was put aside on a procedural vote of 42 to 41, that would have had the government publish some laws in German. This was the basis of the Muhlenberg legend, named after the Speaker of the House at the time, Frederick Muhlenberg, a speaker of German descent who abstained from this vote.[178]"},
{"datas": "Napoleon Bonaparte was not short. He was actually slightly taller than the average Frenchman of his time.[179] After his death in 1821, the French emperor's height was recorded as 5\u00a0feet 2\u00a0inches in French feet, which in English measurements is 5\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches (1.70\u00a0m).[180] He was actually nicknamed le Petit Caporal (The Little Corporal) as a term of endearment.[181] Napoleon was often accompanied by his imperial guard, who were selected for their height[182]\u2014this may have contributed to a perception that he was comparatively short.\nCinco de Mayo is not Mexico's Independence Day, but the celebration of the Mexican Army's victory over the French in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. Mexico's Declaration of Independence from Spain in 1810 is celebrated on September 16.[183]\nThe Alaska Purchase was generally popular in the United States, both among the public and the press. The opponents of the purchase who characterized it as \"Seward's Folly\", alluding to William H. Seward, the Secretary of State who negotiated it, represented a minority opinion at the time.[184]\nCowboy hats were not initially popular in the Western American frontier, with derby or bowler hats being the typical headgear of choice.[185] Heavy marketing of the Stetson \"Boss of the Plains\" model in the years following the American Civil War was the primary driving force behind the cowboy hat's popularity, with its characteristic dented top not becoming standard until near the end of the 19th century.[186]\nDespite being referenced commonly in culture[187][188] and society at large,[189][190] the idea that Victorian Era doctors invented the vibrator to cure female \"hysteria\" via triggering orgasm is a product of a single work.[191] rejected by most historians.[187][190][192]\nThe Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was not caused by Mrs. O'Leary's cow kicking over a lantern. A newspaper reporter later admitted to having invented the story to make colorful copy.[193]\nThe claim that Frederic Remington, on assignment to Cuba in 1897, telegraphed William Randolph Hearst, \"There will be no war. I wish to return,\" and that Hearst responded, \"Please remain. You furnish the pictures, and I'll furnish the war\" is unsubstantiated. This anecdote was originally included in a book by James Creelman, though there is no evidence that the telegraph exchange ever happened, and substantial evidence that it did not.[194]\nImmigrants' last names were not Americanized (voluntarily, mistakenly, or otherwise) upon arrival at Ellis Island. Officials there kept no records other than checking ship manifests created at the point of origin, and there was simply no paperwork that would have let them recast surnames, let alone any law. At the time in New York, anyone could change the spelling of their name simply by using that new spelling.[195] These names are often referred to as an \"Ellis Island Special\".\nThe common image of Santa Claus (Father Christmas) as a jolly old man in red robes was not created by The Coca-Cola Company as an advertising gimmick. Despite being historically represented with different characteristics in different colors of robes, Santa Claus had already taken his modern form in popular culture and seen extensive use in other companies' advertisements and other mass media at the time Coca-Cola began using his image in the 1930s.[196]\nThe paralytic illness of Franklin D. Roosevelt is now thought unlikely to be polio, which was the diagnosis at the time in 1921, but rather more consistent with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.[197]\nItalian dictator Benito Mussolini did not \"make the trains run on time\". Much of the repair work had been performed before Mussolini and the Fascists came to power in 1922. Accounts from the era also suggest that the Italian railways' legendary adherence to timetables was more propaganda than reality.[198]\nThere was no widespread outbreak of panic across the United States in response to Orson Welles's 1938 radio adaptation of H.G. Wells's The War of the Worlds. Only a very small share of the radio audience was even listening to it, and isolated reports of scattered incidents and increased call volume to emergency services were played up the next day by newspapers, eager to discredit radio as a competitor for advertising. Both Welles and CBS, which had initially reacted apologetically, later came to realize that the myth benefited them and actively embraced it in later years.[199]\nThere is no evidence of Polish cavalry mounting a brave but futile charge against German tanks using lances and sabers during the German invasion of Poland in 1939. This story may have originated from German propaganda efforts following the charge at Krojanty, in which a Polish cavalry brigade surprised German infantry in the open, and successfully charged and dispersed them, until driven off by armored cars. While Polish cavalry still carried the saber for such opportunities, they were trained to fight as highly mobile, dismounted cavalry (dragoons) and issued with light anti-tank weapons.[200] During the occupation of Denmark by the Nazis during World War II, King Christian X of Denmark did not thwart Nazi attempts to identify Jews by wearing a yellow star himself. Jews in Denmark were never forced to wear the Star of David. The Danish resistance did help most Jews flee the country before the end of the war.[201]"},

This belief came from an early studio press release announcing the film's production that used his name to generate interest in the film. But by the time it had come out, Warner Bros. knew that Reagan was unavailable for any roles in the foreseeable future since he was no longer able to defer his entry into military service.[204] Studio records show that producer Hal B. Wallis had always wanted Bogart for the part.[205]\nU.S. Senator George Smathers never gave a speech to a rural audience describing his opponent, Claude Pepper, as an \"extrovert\" whose sister was a \"thespian\", in the apparent hope they would confuse them with similar-sounding words like \"pervert\" and \"lesbian\". Time, which is sometimes cited as the source, described the story of the purported speech as a \"yarn\" at the time,[206] and no Florida newspaper reported such a speech during the campaign. The leading reporter who covered Smathers said he always gave the same boilerplate speech. Smathers had offered US$10,000 to anyone who could prove he had made the speech; it was never claimed.[207]\nRosa Parks was not sitting in the front (\"white\") section of the bus during the event that made her famous and incited the Montgomery bus boycott. Rather, she was sitting in the front of the back (\"colored\") section of the bus, where African Americans were expected to sit, but refused to give up her seat to a white man who asked for it (which was also the expected action of African Americans at the time).\nUS President John F. Kennedy's words \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" are standard German for \"I am a Berliner.\"[208] There is a widespread belief that by not leaving out the indefinite article \"ein,\" he changed the meaning of the sentence from the intended \"I am a citizen of Berlin\" to \"I am a Berliner\" (a Berliner being a type of German pastry, similar to a jelly doughnut), amusing Germans throughout the city. Although the word \"Berliner\" is used for a jelly doughnut in the north, west and southwest of Germany, it is not used in Berlin itself or the surrounding region, where the usual word is \"Pfannkuchen\" (literally \"pancake\").[209]\nAfrican-American intellectual and activist W.E.B. Du Bois did not renounce his U.S. citizenship while living in Ghana shortly before his death,[210] as is often claimed.[211] In early 1963, his membership in the Communist Party and support for the Soviet Union incited the U.S. State Department not to renew his passport while he was already in Ghana overseeing the creation of the Encyclopedia Africana. After leaving the embassy, he stated his intention to renounce his citizenship in protest. But while he took Ghanaian citizenship, he never went through the process of renouncing his American citizenship,[212] and may not even have intended to.[210]\nWhen bartender Kitty Genovese was murdered outside her Queens apartment in 1964, there were not 37 neighbors standing idly by and watching who failed to call the police until after she was dead, as The New York Times initially reported[213] to widespread public outrage that persisted for years. Later reporting established that the police report the Times had initially relied on was inaccurate, that Genovese had been attacked twice in different locations, and that, while the many witnesses heard the attack, they only heard brief portions and did not realize what was occurring, with only six or seven actually reporting seeing anything. Some called police; one said \"I didn't want to get involved\",[failed verification] an attitude later attributed to all the residents who saw or heard part of the attack.[214]\nThe Rolling Stones were not performing \"Sympathy for the Devil\" at the 1969 Altamont Free Concert when Meredith Hunter was stabbed to death by a member of the local Hells Angels chapter that was serving as security. While the incident that culminated in Hunter's death began while the band was performing the song, prompting a brief interruption before the Stones finished it, it concluded several songs later as the band was performing \"Under My Thumb\".[215] The misconception arose from mistaken reporting in Rolling Stone.[216]\nWhile it was praised by one architectural magazine before it was built as \"the best high apartment of the year\", the Pruitt\u2013Igoe housing project in St. Louis, Missouri, considered to epitomize the failures of urban renewal in American cities after it was demolished in the early 1970s, never won any awards for its design.[217] The architectural firm that designed the buildings did win an award for an earlier St. Louis project, which may have been confused with Pruitt\u2013Igoe.[218]\nAlthough popularly known as the \"red telephone\", the Moscow\u2013Washington hotline was never a telephone line, nor were red phones used. The first implementation of the hotline used teletype equipment, which was replaced by facsimile (fax) machines in 1988.

It is not the color of the cape, but the perceived threat by the matador that incites it to charge.[237]\nDogs do not sweat by salivating[238] Dogs actually do have sweat glands and not only on their tongues; they sweat mainly through their footpads. However, dogs do primarily regulate their body temperature through panting.[239] (See also: Dog anatomy).\nDogs do not age consistently seven times as quickly as humans. Aging in dogs varies widely depending on the breed; certain breeds, such as giant dog breeds and English bulldogs, have much shorter lifespans than average. Most dogs age consistently across all breeds in the first year of life, reaching adolescence by one year old; smaller and medium-sized breeds begin to age more slowly in adulthood.[240]\nLemmings do not engage in mass suicidal dives off cliffs when migrating. This misconception was popularized by the Disney film White Wilderness, which shot many of the migration scenes (also staged by using multiple shots of different groups of lemmings) on a large, snow-covered turntable in a studio. Photographers later pushed the lemmings off a cliff.[241] The misconception itself is much older, dating back to at least the late 19th century, though its exact origins are uncertain.[242]\nBats are not blind. While about 70 percent of bat species, mainly in the microbat family, use echolocation to navigate, all bat species have eyes and are capable of sight. In addition, almost all bats in the megabat or fruit bat family cannot echolocate and have excellent night vision.[243]\nOstriches do not stick their heads in the sand to hide from enemies or to sleep.[244] This misconception's origins are uncertain but it was probably popularized by Pliny the Elder (23\u201379 CE), who wrote that ostriches \"imagine, when they have thrust their head and neck into a bush, that the whole of their body is concealed.\"[245]\nA duck's quack actually does echo,[246] although the echo may be difficult to hear for humans under some circumstances.[247]\nFrogs die immediately when cast into boiling water, rather than leaping out; furthermore, frogs will attempt to escape cold water that is slowly heated past their critical thermal maximum.[248]\nThe notion that goldfish have a memory span of just a few seconds is false.[249][250] It is much longer, counted in months.\nSharks can suffer from cancer.

Reports of carcinomas in sharks exist, and current data does not support any conclusions about the incidence of tumors in sharks.[251]\nGreat white sharks do not mistake human divers for pinnipeds. Their attack behaviors on humans and pinnipeds are very different: when attacking a seal, a great white shark surfaces quickly and violently attacks it. Attacks on humans, on the other hand, are more relaxed and slow: the shark charges at a normal pace, bites, and swims off. Great white sharks have efficient eyesight and color vision; the bite is not predatory, but rather for identification of an unfamiliar object.[252]\nThere is no such thing as an \"alpha\" in a wolf pack. An early study that coined the term \"alpha wolf\" had only observed unrelated adult wolves living in captivity. In the wild, wolf packs operate more like human families: there is no defined sense of rank, parents are in charge until the young grow up and start their own families, younger wolves do not overthrow an \"alpha\" to become the new leader, and social dominance fights are situational.[253][254]\nSnake jaws cannot unhinge.

When such earthworms are bisected, only the front half of the worm (where the mouth is located) can feed and survive, while the other half dies.[262] Some species of planarian flatworms, however, actually do become two new planarians when bisected or split down the middle.[263]\nHouseflies have an average lifespan of 20 to 30 days, not 24 hours.[264] The misconception may arise from confusion with mayflies, which, in some species, have an adult lifespan of as little as 5 minutes.[265] A housefly egg will hatch into a maggot within 24\u00a0hours of being laid.[266]\nThe daddy longlegs spider (Pholcidae) is not the most venomous spider in the world; though they can indeed pierce human skin, the tiny amount of venom they carry causes only a mild burning sensation for a few seconds.[267] In addition, there is confusion regarding the use of the name daddy longlegs, because harvestmen (order Opiliones, which are arachnids, but not spiders), crane flies (which are insects), and male mosquitoes (also insects) are also sometimes called daddy longlegs in regional dialects, and may occasionally share the misconception of being venomous.[268][269]\nThe flight mechanism and aerodynamics of the bumblebee (as well as other insects) are quite well understood, despite the urban legend that calculations show that they should not be able to fly. In the 1930s, the French entomologist Antoine Magnan indeed postulated that bumblebees theoretically should not be able to fly in his book Le Vol des Insectes (The Flight of Insects).[270] Magnan later realized his error and retracted the suggestion. However, the hypothesis became generalized to the false notion that \"scientists think that bumblebees should not be able to fly\".\nThe widespread urban legend that one swallows a high number of spiders during sleep in one's life has no basis in reality. A sleeping person causes all kinds of noise and vibrations by breathing, their heart's beating, snoring etc., all of which warn spiders of danger.[271][272]\nEarwigs are not known to purposely climb into external ear canals, though there have been anecdotal reports of earwigs being found in the ear.[273] Entomologists suggest that the origin of the name is actually a reference to the appearance of the hindwings, which are unique and distinctive among insects, and resemble a human ear when unfolded.[274][275]\nEuropean honey bees are often described as essential to human food production, leading to claims that without their pollination, humanity would starve or die out.[276] The quote \"If bees disappeared off the face of the earth, man would only have four years left to live\" has been misattributed to Albert Einstein.[277][278] In fact, many important crops need no insect pollination at all. The ten most important crops,[279] comprising 60% of all human food energy,[280] all fall into this category.\nFemale praying mantises rarely eat the males during coitus, especially in their natural environment. In a study in a laboratory at the University of Central Arkansas, it was observed that 1 out of 45 times the female ate the male before mating and the male ate the female with that same frequency.[281]"},

While it is true that they are mildly irritating to the skin or stomach,[282] and may sometimes cause diarrhea and vomiting if eaten,[283] an American Journal of Emergency Medicine study of 22,793 cases reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers showed no fatalities and few cases requiring medical treatment.[284] According to the ASPCA, poinsettias may cause light to mid-range gastrointestinal discomfort in felines, with diarrhea and vomiting as the most severe consequences of ingestion.[285]\nSunflowers do not always point to the sun. Flowering sunflowers face a fixed direction (often east) all day long, but not necessarily the sun.[286] However, in an earlier developmental stage, before the appearance of flower heads, the immature buds do track the sun (a phenomenon called phototropism) and the fixed alignment of the mature flowers toward a certain direction is often the result.[287]"},
{"datas": "The word theory in \"the theory of evolution\" does not imply scientific doubt regarding its validity; the concepts of theory and hypothesis have specific meanings in a scientific context. While theory in colloquial usage may denote a hunch or conjecture, a scientific theory is a set of principles that explains an observable phenomenon in natural terms.[288][289] \"Scientific fact and theory are not categorically separable\",[290] and evolution is a theory in the same sense as germ theory or the theory of gravitation.[291]\nEvolution does not attempt to explain the origin of life[292] or the origin and development of the universe. The theory of evolution deals primarily with changes in successive generations over time after life has already originated.[293] The scientific model concerned with the origin of the first organisms from organic or inorganic molecules is known as abiogenesis, and the prevailing theory for explaining the early development of our universe is the Big Bang model. A reconstruction of Aegyptopithecus, a primate predating the split between the human and Old World monkey lineages in human evolution\nHumans did not evolve from either of the living species of chimpanzees (common chimpanzees and bonobos).[294] Humans and chimpanzees did, however, evolve from a common ancestor.[295][296] The most recent common ancestor of humans and the living chimpanzees lived between 5 and 8 million years ago.[297]\nEvolution is not a progression from inferior to superior organisms, and it also does not necessarily result in an increase in complexity. A population can evolve to become simpler, having a smaller genome, but biological devolution is a misnomer.[298][299]\nEvolution does not \"plan\" to improve an organism's fitness to survive.[300][301] The misconception is encouraged as it is common shorthand for biologists to speak of a purpose as a concise form of expression (sometimes called the \"metaphor of purpose\");[302] it is less cumbersome to say \"Dinosaurs may have evolved feathers for courtship\" than \"Feathers may have been selected for when they arose as they gave dinosaurs a selective advantage during courtship over their non-feathered rivals\".[303]\nNot all dinosaurs became extinct during the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. Birds evolved from small feathered theropods in the Jurassic, and while most dinosaur lineages were cut short at the end of the Cretaceous, some birds survived. Consequently, dinosaurs are part of the modern fauna.[304]\nHumans and dinosaurs (other than birds) did not coexist.[305] The last of the non-avian dinosaurs died 66 million years ago in the course of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, whereas the earliest members of genus Homo (humans) evolved between 2.3 and 2.4 million years ago. This places a 63-million-year expanse of time between the last non-bird dinosaurs and the earliest humans. Humans did coexist with woolly mammoths and saber-toothed cats\u2014mammals often erroneously depicted alongside dinosaurs.[306] Tyrannosaurus rex. Non-avian dinosaurs died out in the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period.\nPetroleum does not originate from dinosaurs but rather bacteria and algae.[307]\nMammals did not evolve from any modern group of reptiles; rather, mammals and reptiles evolved from a common ancestor. Soon after the first reptile-like animals appeared, they split into two branches, the sauropsids and the synapsids.[308] The line leading to mammals (the synapsids) diverged from the line leading to modern reptilian lines (the sauropsids) about 320 million years ago, in the mid-Carboniferous period. Only later (in the late Carboniferous or Early Permian) did the modern reptilian groups (lepidosaurs, turtles and crocodiles) diverge. The mammals themselves are the only survivors of the synapsid line.[309]"},

Additionally, the portion of people living in extreme poverty has declined as well, no matter which income threshold is used.[316]\nIncome inequality in the US is significantly higher than people think.[317]\nMonopolists do not try to sell items for the highest possible price, nor do they try to maximize profit per unit, but rather they try to maximize total profit.[318]\nFor any given production set, there is not a set amount of labor input (a \"lump of labor\") to produce that output. This fallacy is commonly seen in Luddite and later, related movements as an argument either that automation causes permanent, structural unemployment, or that labor-limiting regulation can decrease unemployment.  But, in fact, changes in capital allocation, efficiency, and economies of learning can change the amount of labor input for a given set of production.[319]\nIncome is not a direct factor in determining credit score in the United States. Rather, credit score is impacted by the amount of unused available credit, which is in turn affected by income.[320] Income is also considered when evaluating creditworthiness more generally.\nThe correlation between racial makeup and house price in the US has risen over the past several decades.[321]\nMillennials still respond to conventional marketing, even as their consumption patterns change.[322]\nThe US public vastly overestimates the amount spent on foreign aid.[323]\nTrickle-down theory of economics does not work.[324]"},

In contrast, sleepwalkers may injure themselves if they trip over objects or lose their balance while sleepwalking.[328]\nEating less than an hour before swimming does not increase the risk of experiencing muscle cramps or drowning. One study shows a correlation between alcohol consumption and drowning, but there is no evidence cited regarding the consumption of food or stomach cramps.[329]\nDrowning is often inconspicuous to onlookers.[330] In most cases, the instinctive drowning response prevents the victim from waving or yelling (known as \"aquatic distress\"),[330] which are therefore not dependable signs of trouble; indeed, most drowning victims undergoing the response do not show prior evidence of distress.[331]\nHuman blood in veins is not actually blue. Hemoglobin gives blood its red color. Deoxygenated blood (in veins) has a deep red color, and oxygenated blood (in arteries) has a light cherry-red color. The misconception probably arises for two reasons: 1) Veins below the skin appear blue or green. This is due to a variety of reasons only weakly dependent on the color of the blood, including subsurface scattering of light through the skin, and human color perception. 2) Many diagrams use colors to show the difference between veins (usually shown in blue) and arteries (usually shown in red).[332]\nExposure to a vacuum, or experiencing all but the most extreme uncontrolled decompression, does not cause the body to explode, or internal fluids to boil. (However, fluids in the mouth or lungs will boil at altitudes above the Armstrong limit.) Instead, it will lead to a loss of consciousness once the body has depleted the supply of oxygen in the blood, followed by death from hypoxia within minutes.[333]\nStretching before or after exercise does not reduce muscle soreness.[334]\nExercise-induced muscle soreness is not caused by lactic acid buildup.[335] Muscular lactic acid levels during and after exercise do not correlate with soreness;[336] exercise-induced muscle soreness is thought to be due to microtrauma from an unaccustomed or strenuous exercise, against which the body adapts with repeated bouts of the same exercise.[337]\nSwallowing gasoline does not generally require special emergency treatment, as long as it goes into the stomach and not the lungs, and inducing vomiting can make it worse.[338]\nUrine is not sterile, not even in the bladder.[339]\nPeople tend to overestimate the physical strength of black men.[340]"},

The number of senses in various categorizations ranges from five to more than 20. In addition to sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing, which were the senses identified by Aristotle, humans can sense balance and acceleration (equilibrioception), pain (nociception), body and limb position (proprioception or kinesthetic sense), and relative temperature (thermoception).[346] Other senses sometimes identified are the sense of time, echolocation, itching, pressure, hunger, thirst, fullness of the stomach, need to urinate, need to defecate, and blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.[347]"},

This belief is due to hair that has never been cut having a tapered end, whereas, after cutting, the edge is blunt and therefore thicker than the tapered ends; the sharper, unworn edges make the cut hair appear thicker and feel coarser. That short hairs are less flexible than longer hairs also contributes to this effect.[351]\nA person's hair and fingernails do not continue to grow after death. Rather, the skin dries and shrinks away from the bases of hairs and nails, giving the appearance of growth.[352]\nHair care products cannot actually \"repair\" split ends and damaged hair. They can prevent damage from occurring in the first place, and they can also smooth down the cuticle in a glue-like fashion so that it appears repaired, and generally make hair appear in better condition.[353]\nPulling or cutting a grey hair will not cause two grey hairs to grow in its place.

This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment.[366]\nAlcohol does not necessarily kill brain cells.[367] Alcohol can, however, lead indirectly to the death of brain cells in two ways: (1) In chronic, heavy alcohol users whose brains have adapted to the effects of alcohol, abrupt ceasing following heavy use can cause excitotoxicity leading to cellular death in multiple areas of the brain.[368] (2) In alcoholics who get most of their daily calories from alcohol, a deficiency of thiamine can produce Korsakoff's syndrome, which is associated with serious brain damage.[369]\nA vegetarian or vegan diet can provide enough protein for adequate nutrition.[370] In fact, typical protein intakes of ovo-lacto vegetarians and vegans meet or exceed requirements.[371] However, a vegan diet does require supplementation of vitamin B12 for optimal health.[370]\nSwallowed chewing gum does not take seven years to digest.

If one hemisphere is damaged or removed at an early age, these functions can often be recovered in part, or even in full, by the other hemisphere (see neuroplasticity). Other abilities, such as motor control, memory, and general reasoning, are served equally by the two hemispheres.[394]\nIt is not true that by the age of two years, humans have generated all of the brain cells they will ever have, a belief held by medical experts until 1998.[395] It is now understood that new neurons can be created in some parts of the postnatal brain.[396] A 2013 study showed that also in old age, about 700 new neurons are produced in the hippocampus daily.[397]\nVaccines do not cause autism or autism spectrum disorders.

In addition, leprosy is only mildly contagious, with it assumed that 95% of those infected are able to fight the infection naturally.[416] In fact, Hansen's disease is one of the least contagious diseases in the world.[415] Tzaraath, the Biblical disease often identified as \"leprosy\" and the source of many myths about the disease, may or may not have been the disease known in modern times by that name.[417] The misconception also stems from the discontinuity between science and government policy.

Despite having the appearance of representing a smaller number, 0.999... is a symbol for the number 1 in exactly the same way that .333... is an equivalent notation for the number represented by the fraction 1/3.[456]\nThere is no evidence that the ancient Greeks deliberately designed the Parthenon to match the golden ratio.[457] The Parthenon was completed in 438\u00a0BCE, more than a century before the first recorded mention of the ratio by Euclid. Similarly, Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man makes no mention of the golden ratio in its text, although it describes many other proportions.[458]"},
{"datas": "It is not true that lift force is generated by the air taking the same time to travel above and below an aircraft's wing.[459] This misconception, sometimes called the equal transit-time fallacy, is widespread among textbooks and non-technical reference books, and even appears in pilot training materials. In fact, the air moving over the top of an aerofoil generating lift is always moving much faster than the equal transit theory would imply,[459] as described in the incorrect and correct explanations of lift force.\nBlowing over a curved piece of paper does not demonstrate Bernoulli's principle. Although a common classroom experiment is often explained this way,[460] it is false to make a connection between the flow on the two sides of the paper using Bernoulli's equation since the air above and below are different flow fields and Bernoulli's principle only applies within a flow field.[461] The paper rises because the air follows the curve of the paper and a curved streamline will develop pressure differences perpendicular to the airflow.[462] Bernoulli's principle predicts that the decrease in pressure is associated with an increase in speed, that is, that as the air passes over the paper it speeds up and moves faster than it was moving when it left the demonstrator's mouth. But this is not apparent from the demonstration.[463]\nThe Coriolis effect does not cause water to consistently drain from basins in a clockwise/counter-clockwise direction depending on the hemisphere. The common myth often refers to the draining action of flush toilets and bathtubs. Rotation is determined by whatever minor rotation is initially present at the time the water starts to drain. The Coriolis force can impact the direction of the flow of water but only in rare circumstances. The water has to be so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container and the externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) have to be very small.\nNeither gyroscopic forces nor geometric trail are required for a rider to balance a bicycle or for it to demonstrate self-stability.[464][465] Although gyroscopic forces and trail can be contributing factors, it has been demonstrated that those factors are neither required nor sufficient by themselves.[464]\nThe idea that lightning never strikes the same place twice is one of the oldest and best-known superstitions about lightning, but has no basis in evidence. Lightning in a thunderstorm in a given area is more likely to strike objects and spots the more prominent or conductive they are. Lightning strikes the Empire State Building in New York City about 100 times per year.[466][467]\nHeat lightning does not exist as a distinct phenomenon. What is mistaken for \"heat lightning\" is usually ordinary lightning from storms too distant to hear the associated thunder; such lightning carries the same risk of striking a person as ordinary lightning.[468]\nA penny dropped from the Empire State Building would not kill a person or crack the sidewalk, though it could cause injury.[469]\nUsing a programmable thermostat's setback feature to limit heating or cooling in a temporarily unoccupied building does not waste as much energy as leaving the temperature constant. Using setback saves energy (five to fifteen percent) because heat transfer across the surface of the building is roughly proportional to the temperature difference between its inside and the outside.[470][471]\nIt is not possible for a person to completely drown in quicksand, as commonly depicted in fiction,[472] although sand entrapment in the nearshore of a body of water can be a drowning hazard as the tide rises.[473]"},
{"datas": "Dyslexia is not a cognitive disorder characterized by the reversal of letters or words and mirror writing. It is a disorder of people who have at least average intelligence and who have difficulty in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, \"sounding out\" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud, or understanding what they read. Although some dyslexics also have problems with letter reversal, it is not a symptom. Letter reversal can be a characteristic in some cases of dyslexia, but dyslexia is not diagnosed on the basis of seeing or writing letters or words backward or in reverse.[474]\nThere is no scientific evidence for the existence of \"photographic\" memory in adults (the ability to remember images with so high a precision as to mimic a camera),[475] but some young children have eidetic memory.[476] Many people have claimed to have a photographic memory, but those people have been shown to have good memories as a result of mnemonic devices rather than a natural capacity for detailed memory encoding.[477] There are rare cases of individuals with exceptional memory, but none of them has a memory that mimics that of a camera.\nSchizophrenia is not split or multiple personality disorder\u2014a split or multiple personality is dissociative identity disorder.[478] The term was coined from the Greek roots schizein and phr\u0113n, \"to split\" and \"mind\", in reference to a \"splitting of mental functions\" seen in schizophrenia, not a splitting of the personality.[479]\nAll humans learn in fundamentally similar ways.[480] In particular, there is no evidence that people have different learning styles,[480] or that catering teaching styles to purported learning styles improves information retention.[481]\nThe friendship paradox is the phenomenon first observed by the sociologist Scott L. Feld in 1991 that most people have fewer friends than their friends have, on average.[482] It can be explained as a form of sampling bias in which people with more friends than the study participants have are also likelier than average to be observed among the participants' own friends. In contradiction to this, most people believe that they have more friends than their friends have.[483]\nSelf-harm is not generally an attention-seeking behavior. Many self-harmers are very self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behavior, leading them to go to great lengths to conceal their behavior from others.[484] They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing.[485]\nPedophilia is not the same as child sexual abuse. Pedophilia is the condition of an adult being exclusively or predominantly attracted to pre-pubescent children, while child sexual abuse is the act of an adult, pedophile or not, having sexual relations with pre-pubescent children. Also, sexual attraction to post-pubescent children and adolescents receive different terms, such as hebephilia (ages 11 to 14) and ephebophilia (ages 15 to 19).[486]\nThere is no evidence that violent video games have any negative effects on humans (\"cause people to become violent\"). While there are examples of video games influencing the behavior of culprit individuals (such as the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre), studies have consistently found no link between aggression and violent video games,[487] and the popularity of gaming has coincided with a decrease in youth violence.[488] Nonetheless, the moral panic surrounding video games in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, alongside isolated incidents and legislation in many countries, likely contributed to proliferating this notion.[489]"},
{"datas": "The Bermuda Triangle does not have any more shipwrecks or mysterious disappearances than most other waterways.[490]\nToilet waste is never intentionally jettisoned from an aircraft. All waste is collected in tanks and emptied into toilet waste vehicles.[491] Blue ice is caused by accidental leakage from the waste tank. Passenger trains, on the other hand, have indeed historically flushed onto the tracks; modern trains usually have retention tanks on board and therefore do not dispose of waste in such a manner.\nAutomotive batteries stored on a concrete floor do not discharge any faster than they would on other surfaces,[492] in spite of worry among Americans that concrete harms batteries.[493] Early batteries with porous, leaky cases may have been susceptible to moisture from floors, but for many years lead\u2013acid car batteries have had impermeable polypropylene cases.[494] While most modern automotive batteries are sealed, and do not leak battery acid when properly stored and maintained,[495] the sulfuric acid in them can leak out and stain, etch, or corrode concrete floors if their cases crack or tip over or their vent-holes are breached by floods.[496]"},
